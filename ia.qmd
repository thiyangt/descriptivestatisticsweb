Date released: July 9, 2024

As part of your coursework, you will be working on an individual assignment. This assignment will contribute 20% towards your final grade. 

Below are the details:

**Objective:**

The aim of this assignment is to develop your data analysis and presentation skills by selecting and analyzing a publicly available data set. You will prepare a research poster in A1 size, including charts, tables, and interpretations, all hand-drawn. The final poster should be scanned and uploaded to Google Classroom and the Learning Management System (LMS).

**Steps to Complete the Assignment:**

**1. Select a Publicly Available Data Set:**

- Choose a data set from a reputable source such as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics, or any other publicly available data set.

- Ensure the data set is relevant to a topic of your interest and has sufficient data points for analysis.

- If you find a very large data set, select a subset of the data. As you are going to do the calculations manually, it will be difficult to handle a large data set. It is recommended not to select data sets with more than 100 rows.

**2. Analyze Your Data Set:**

- Conduct a thorough analysis of the data set using charts and tables.

- Hand-Drawn Elements:

All charts, tables, and interpretations must be hand-drawn. Ensure they are clear, well-labeled, and accurately represent your findings.


**3.** Prepare a research poster

- Your poster should be A1 size and include the following sections:

**Introduction:**

Provide an overview of the topic and the importance of the data set.

**Objectives of the Study:**

Clearly state the goals and objectives of your analysis.

**Data:**

Describe the data set, including its source, type of data, and any preprocessing steps taken.
(for example if you select a subset, you can mention it here)

**Data Analysis:**

Present your findings using **hand-drawn** charts and tables. Each visual and table should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.

**Conclusions:**

Summarize the key insights and implications of your analysis.

**Name and Index number**

Clearly mention your index number and name.

**4. Submission**

- Once your poster is complete, scan it to create a digital copy.

- Upload the dataset that you used for the data analysis.

- You can show your calculation in separate A4 sheets (maximum pages 4 (that means 2 A4 sheets with both sides))

- Upload the scanned poster, calculation sheet and dataset to both Google Classroom and the LMS by the specified deadline.



**5. Submission deadline**

July 21, 2024

**You have been given a 11 days timeframe to complete the assignment. Please begin work promptly to accommodate any unforeseen circumstances.**
