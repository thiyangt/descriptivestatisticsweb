## Spearman's rank correlation

- Pearson's correlation coefficient: at least interval level of measurement for the data

- Spearman's rank correlation: at least ordinal-level or ranked data

$r = 1 - \frac{6\sum_{i=1}^nd^2}{n(n^2-1)}$

where

$n = \text{number of pairs being correlated.}$

$d = \text{the difference in the ranks of each pair}$

## Example

Compute Spearman's rank correlation for the following variables to determine the degree of association between the two variables.

```{r}
x <- c(10, 10, 4, 20, 30, 40, 40, 30, 20, 10)

y <- c(3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 1)
df <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)
df |> knitr::kable()
```



# Important

- Pearson's correlation determines the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

- Spearman's correlation determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship.

- The Spearman's rank correlation formula is derived from the Pearson product moment formula and utilises the ranks of the $n$ pairs instead of the raw data.
