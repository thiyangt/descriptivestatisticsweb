This includes allocating enough time to research, plan, and write the assignment, as well as allowing for unexpected circumstances or delays. It is important for students to plan their workload and prioritize their assignments to ensure that they are able to complete them on time and to the best of their ability.

**Late submission:** Submitting late work will be penalized by 1 mark per day. I will not accept any submissions after August 15, 2024.
