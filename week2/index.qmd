### Population

The population is the [complete collection]{style="color:red;"} of individuals or objects that are of interest.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip2.png")
```

## Example

1. Population

we're interested in studying the average height of [all adults in a country]{style="color:blue;"}, the population would be all adult residents of that country.

## Unit

A unit is a single member of the population. It could be an individual or an object.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip3.png")
```

## Unit

A unit is a single member of the population. It could be an individual or an object.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip4.png")
```

## Example

1. Population

we're interested in studying the average height of [all adults in a country]{style="color:blue;"}, the population would be all adult residents of that country.

2. Unit

In our example of studying adult height, [each adult residing]{style="color:blue;"} in the country would be a unit.

## Sample 

A subset of units in a population

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip5.png")
```

## Sample 

A subset of units in a population

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip6.png")
```

## Sampling

Sampling is the [process]{style="color:red;"} of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a population

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip7.png")
```

## Statistics

A numerical summary of a sample.

<!--A numerical value summarizing the sample data.-->

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip8.png")
```

## Parameter

A numerical summary of a population.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip9.png")
```

## Inferential Statistics

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip10.png")
```

## Inferential Statistics

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip11.png")
```

## Census vs Sample Survey




## Notations

[Parameters]{style="color:red;"} are usually denoted by Greek letters

Example:

$\mu - \text{population mean}$

$\sigma - \text{population variance}$

[Statistics]{style="color:blue;"} are denoted by English letters (Capital or Simple? You will learn more of this in your "Statistical Inference" course)

Eample:

$\bar{X} - \text{sample mean}$

$S^2 - \text{sample variance}$

## Inclass demo

- The value of the population parameter does not change.

- Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.

## Your turn: Question 1

A researcher is studying the biodiversity of Beira Lake. To estimate the proportion of species counts, he took a bucket of water (1L) from the lake and counted how many species of bacteria, bugs, and other creepy crawlies he found in the bucket.

Identify the following terms related to this study:

i. Population

ii. Sample

iii. Parameter

iv. Statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 6, seconds = 00)
```

## Your turn: Question 2

A researcher wants to estimate the failure rate of hard disk drives (HDDs) produced by a computer manufacturing company. The researcher randomly selects 100 HDDs from a recent production batch and examines them for signs of malfunction or failure.

Identify the following terms related to this study:

i. Population

ii. Sample

iii. Parameter

iv. Statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)
```

## Your turn: Question 3

The lecturer-in-charge is interested in estimating the proportion of students who actively listen to lectures during online Zoom sessions. She randomly selected 50 students and asked questions related to the content covered during the lecture.

Identify the following terms related to this study:

i. Population

ii. Sample

iii. Parameter

iv. Statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)
```

## Your turn: Question 4

A researcher is interested in estimating the mean  monthly expenditure of government university students on educational expenses per semester. The researcher randomly selects 100 government university students and asks them to report their total expenditure for the last month and compute sample mean.

Identify the following terms related to this study:

i. Population

ii. Sample

iii. Parameter

iv. Statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
