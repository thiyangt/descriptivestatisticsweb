### Population

The population is the [complete collection]{style="color:red;"} of individuals or objects that are of interest.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip2.png")
```

## Example

1. Population

we're interested in studying the average height of [all adults in a country]{style="color:blue;"}, the population would be all adult residents of that country.

## Unit

A unit is a single member of the population. It could be an individual or an object.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip3.png")
```

## Unit

A unit is a single member of the population. It could be an individual or an object.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip4.png")
```

## Example

1. Population

we're interested in studying the average height of [all adults in a country]{style="color:blue;"}, the population would be all adult residents of that country.

2. Unit

In our example of studying adult height, [each adult residing]{style="color:blue;"} in the country would be a unit.

## Sample 

A subset of units in a population

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip5.png")
```

## Sample 

A subset of units in a population

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip6.png")
```

## Sampling

Sampling is the [process]{style="color:red;"} of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a population

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip7.png")
```

## Statistics

A numerical summary of a sample.


```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip8.png")
```

## Parameter

A numerical summary of a population.

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip9.png")
```

## Inferential Statistics

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip10.png")
```

## Inferential Statistics

```{r, out.height="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ip11.png")
```
