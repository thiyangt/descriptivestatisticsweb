## Variance of a sample

The variance of a sample of `n` observations $x_1, x_2, x_3,..,x_n$ having mean $\bar{x}$ is defined as

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

Alternatively, the sample variance can be written in the following forms:

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}[\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i)^2}{n}]$$

or

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}[\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2-n\bar{x}]$$

## Measures of relative standing/ Measures of noncentral location

-   Quartiles

-   Percentiles

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quantiles

Quantiles are descriptive measures that split the ordered data into four quarters (four equal parts).

Q1 - first (lower) quantile

Q2 - second (middle) quantile

Q3 - third (upper) quantile

> First quantile

The value which 25% of the observations are smaller and 75% are larger

$$Q_1 = \frac{n+1}{4} \text{ ordered observation}$$

> Second quantile

Same as median

> Third quantile

The value for which 75% of the observations are smaller and 25% are larger

$$Q_3 = \frac{3(n+1)}{4} \text{ ordered observation}$$

## Rules

1.  If the resulting positioning point is an integer, take the particular value corresponding to that positioning point.

2.  For a non-integer position $p$, let $k$ be the integer part and $d$ be the fractional part (e.g., for $p=2.75$, $k=2$ and $d=0.75$)

$$Q_q = ((1-d) \times \text{ value at position }k )+ (d \times \text{ value at position } (k+1))$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)
```

## Percentiles

-   Percentiles divides a given ordered data array into 100 equal parts, it divides the complete data set into hundred groups of 1% each. There are total of 99 percentiles denoted as P1, P2, P3,…, and, P99, and they are known as 1st percentile, 2nd percentile,…., 99th percentile respectively.

first decile = 10th percentile

Q1 = 25th percentile

Q2 = 50th percentile

Q3 = 75th percentile

ninth decile = 90th percentile

**Location of a percentile**

The following formula allows us to approximate the location of any percentile.

$$L_p = (n+1)\frac{p}{100}$$

where $L_p$ is the location of the $p^{th}$ percentile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your turn

Find $L_{25}$, $L_{50}$ and $L_{75}$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(countdown)

```

## Interquartile Range (IQR)

-   Measure of dispersion

$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$

-   Measure considers the spread in the middle 50% of the data.

-   Not influenced by extreme values.

## Your turn

Prices of Chocolate in Rupees (LKR):

50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275

Prices of Chocolate in USD:

5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23, 26, 0

Which group of chocolate prices exhibits the highest variation?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coefficient of variation

-   Relative measure of variation

-   It always expressed as a percentage rather than in terms of the units of the particular data.

-   This is useful when comparing two or more sets of data that are measured in the different units.

$$CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}\times 100\%$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The coefficient of variation of the height of 30 people selected at random from a given village is found to be 15%. The mean weight of the selected group is 72 kg and a standard deviation 8 kg.

The obtained results show that

A)  the weight is more variable than height.

B)  the weight is less variable than height.

C)  height and weight have the same degree of variation.

D)  height and weight values are identical.

## Skewness and the relationship of the mean, median and mode

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In-class diagram:

::: {.column width="50%"}
Skewness describes the degree and direction of asymmetry in the data.

Formula used to calculate skewness in Excel:

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{8})^3$$
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Skewness

-   Skewness is the degree of asymmetry of a distribution.

-   If the frequency distribution has a longer “tail” to the right of the central maximum than to the left, the distribution is said to be skewed to the right (or to have a positive skewness).

-   If the reverse is true, it is said to be skewed to the left (or to have a negative skewness)

> Pearson's first coefficient of skewness

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{\text{mean}-\text{mode}}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

or

> Pearson's second coefficient of skewness

To avoid using the mode

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{3(\text{mean}-\text{median})}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conditions

1.  $Mean = Mode = Median$, then the coefficient of skewness is zero for symmetrical distribution.

2.  $Mean > Mode$, then the coefficient of skewness will be positive.

3.  $Mean < Mode$, then the coefficient of skewness will be negative.

Karl person\`s coefficient of skewness has a positive sign for the positively skewed and a negative sign for the negatively skewed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Empirical relationship between mean, median and mode

Using Karl Pearson’s formula we can show

$3 (median) = mode + 2 mean$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

1.  **Symmetric**

$Mean = Median = Mode$

2.  **Positively Skewed**

$Mean > Median > Mode$

3.  **Negatively Skewed**

$Mean < Median < Mode$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Kurtosis

-   Degree of peakness of a distribution

-   Usually taken relative to a normal distribution

```{r}
Type <- c("Mesokurtic", "Leptokurtic", "Platykurtic")
Kurtosis <- c("=3", ">3", "<3")
Ek <- c("=0", ">0", "<0")
ts <- tibble(Type=Type, Kurtosis=Kurtosis, `Excess Kurtosis`=Ek)
ts |> knitr::kable()
```

Excess Kurtosis = Kurtosis - 3

       x = "Species",

  summarise(
    Mean = mean(flipper_length_mm),
    Median = median(flipper_length_mm),
    Mode = as.numeric(names(sort(table(flipper_length_mm), decreasing = TRUE)[1])),
    SD = sd(flipper_length_mm),
    Q1 = quantile(flipper_length_mm, 0.25),
    Q2 = quantile(flipper_length_mm, 0.50),
    Q3 = quantile(flipper_length_mm, 0.75),
    Kurtosis = kurtosis(flipper_length_mm),
    Skewness = skewness(flipper_length_mm)
  )

kable(descriptive_stats_penguins, format = "html") %>%

  theme_minimal()
```

-   The distributions of flipper lengths for each species appear to be roughly symmetric.

-   Gentoo penguins have longer flippers than both Adélie and Chinstrap penguins, which have similar flipper lengths.

-   There are two notable outliers in the flipper lengths for Adélie penguins, which are visible in the boxplot.
