## Variance of a sample

The variance of a sample of `n` observations $x_1, x_2, x_3,..,x_n$ having mean $\bar{x}$ is defined as

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

Alternatively, the sample variance can be written in the following forms:

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}[\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i)^2}{n}]$$

or

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}[\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2-n\bar{x}]$$

## Measures of relative standing/ Measures of noncentral location

-   Quartiles

-   Percentiles

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quantiles

Quantiles are descriptive measures that split the ordered data into four quarters (four equal parts).

Q1 - first (lower) quantile

Q2 - second (middle) quantile

Q3 - third (upper) quantile

> First quantile

The value which 25% of the observations are smaller and 75% are larger

$$Q_1 = \frac{n+1}{4} \text{ ordered observation}$$

> Second quantile

Same as median

> Third quantile

The value for which 75% of the observations are smaller and 25% are larger

$$Q_3 = \frac{3(n+1)}{4} \text{ ordered observation}$$

## Rules

1.  If the resulting positioning point is an integer, take the particular value corresponding to that positioning point.

2.  For a non-integer position $p$, let $k$ be the integer part and $d$ be the fractional part (e.g., for $p=2.75$, $k=2$ and $d=0.75$)

$$Q_q = ((1-d) \times \text{ value at position }k )+ (d \times \text{ value at position } (k+1))$$

```

## Percentiles

-   Percentiles divides a given ordered data array into 100 equal parts, it divides the complete data set into hundred groups of 1% each. There are total of 99 percentiles denoted as P1, P2, P3,…, and, P99, and they are known as 1st percentile, 2nd percentile,…., 99th percentile respectively.

first decile = 10th percentile

Q1 = 25th percentile

Q2 = 50th percentile

Q3 = 75th percentile

ninth decile = 90th percentile

**Location of a percentile**

The following formula allows us to approximate the location of any percentile.

$$L_p = (n+1)\frac{p}{100}$$

where $L_p$ is the location of the $p^{th}$ percentile.

## Interquartile Range (IQR)

-   Measure of dispersion

$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$

-   Measure considers the spread in the middle 50% of the data.

-   Not influenced by extreme values.

## Coefficient of variation

-   Relative measure of variation

-   It always expressed as a percentage rather than in terms of the units of the particular data.

-   This is useful when comparing two or more sets of data that are measured in the different units.

$$CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}\times 100\%$$

# Measures of shape

## Skewness and the relationship of the mean, median and mode

In-class diagram:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Skewness

-   Skewness is the degree of asymmetry of a distribution.

-   If the frequency distribution has a longer “tail” to the right of the central maximum than to the left, the distribution is said to be skewed to the right (or to have a positive skewness).

-   If the reverse is true, it is said to be skewed to the left (or to have a negative skewness)

> Pearson's first coefficient of skewness

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{\text{mean}-\text{mode}}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

or

> Pearson's second coefficient of skewness

To avoid using the mode

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{3(\text{mean}-\text{median})}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conditions

1.  $Mean = Mode = Median$, then the coefficient of skewness is zero for symmetrical distribution.

2.  $Mean > Mode$, then the coefficient of skewness will be positive.

3.  $Mean < Mode$, then the coefficient of skewness will be negative.

Karl person\`s coefficient of skewness has a positive sign for the positively skewed and a negative sign for the negatively skewed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Empirical relationship between mean, median and mode

Using Karl Pearson’s formula we can show

$3 (median) = mode + 2 mean$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

1.  **Symmetric**

$Mean = Median = Mode$

2.  **Positively Skewed**

$Mean > Median > Mode$

3.  **Negatively Skewed**

$Mean < Median < Mode$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Kurtosis

-   Degree of peakness of a distribution

-   Usually taken relative to a normal distribution

```{r}
Type <- c("Mesokurtic", "Leptokurtic", "Platykurtic")
Kurtosis <- c("=3", ">3", "<3")
Ek <- c("=0", ">0", "<0")
ts <- tibble(Type=Type, Kurtosis=Kurtosis, `Excess Kurtosis`=Ek)
ts |> knitr::kable()
```

Excess Kurtosis = Kurtosis - 3
